Local testing using serverless offline. Firstly make sure sls offline is started. 
sls offline start --stage test
npm test
# This auto restarts the server on any changes.

On authorization success, send back user info as JWT. It contains
required: email, userId (generated), publicUserId (generated), createdAt
optional: fullName, photoUrl

Client saves and sends this JWT with every request that requires user identification. 
Server validates claims and process the request for the user.
